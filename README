A number of Twitter users have single-letter screen names. I'm often asked:
What would our world look like if our alphabet were replaced by the avatars of
these celebrated Twitterers? I had no answer to this question. Until today.

Presenting the Twitter Avatar Keyboard. Each letter you type will be replaced
by the avatar of the Twitter user with the corresponding screen name.
